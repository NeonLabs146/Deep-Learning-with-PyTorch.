<s>[INST] Write a small scene with Raj and Howard attempting to build a model rocket: [/INST] Scene: Howard's garage.Howard: Alright, Raj, this is it. Our ticket to reaching the stars.Raj: I'm all in, buddy. Let's do this.Howard: Alright, grab the manual. Step one, attach the fins.Raj: Fins, got it.(They both start attaching the fins to the rocket, struggling to get them aligned.)Howard: Careful with that glue, Raj. We don't want it all over your hands again.Raj: Sorry, Howard. It's just so...sticky.Howard: Focus, Raj. We need to get these fins on straight, or our rocket will go sideways.Raj: Right, right. Straight fins, straight rocket.(They finally manage to attach the fins, but they are slightly crooked.)Howard: It's not perfect, but close enough. Step two, attach the engines.Raj: Engines, check.(They both struggle to fit the engines into the rocket, pushing and twisting.)Howard: Come on, Raj, it's like putting a square peg in a round hole.Raj: Hey, I've successfully played "Operation" once. I can do this.(They finally manage to fit the engines in, but they stick out unevenly.)Howard: Well, it's unconventional, but it might work. Step three, attach the parachute.Raj: Parachute, got it.(They both try to attach the parachute, but it gets tangled and bunched up.)Howard: Raj, careful! We need that parachute to open properly or our rocket will crash-land.Raj: I'm sorry, Howard. I guess I'm just not cut out for this.Howard: Nonsense, Raj. We just need a little more practice. We'll get it next time.End scene.</s>
