Hence, we call it "dark" matter.Penny: So, it's like invisible stuff?Sheldon: Precisely! It's invisible, yet it has gravitational effects on visible matter.Penny: Okay, I'm officially confused.Sheldon: Well, let me simplify it for you. Imagine a delicious cake.Penny: Ooh, I like cake!Sheldon: Now, imagine that you can't see or taste the cake, but you can feel its weight. That weight you feel is like the gravitational effect of dark matter on visible matter.Penny: Alright, so dark matter is like a weighty invisible cake?Sheldon: In a very crude analogy, yes.Penny: Wow, Sheldon, you really know how to make science delicious!Sheldon: Thank you, Penny. That's high praise coming from you.End Scene.</s>
