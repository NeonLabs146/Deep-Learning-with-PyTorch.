<s>[INST] Write a small scene about Howard and Bernadette trying out a new fitness trend: [/INST] Scene: Howard and Bernadette's living room.Howard: Alright, Bernadette, are you ready to try out this new fitness trend?Bernadette: I guess so. What is it called again?Howard: It's called "hot yoga pole dancing boot camp".Bernadette: Hot what now?Howard: Yeah, apparently it combines the flexibility of yoga, the strength of pole dancing, and the intensity of boot camp. Supposedly it's all the rage.Bernadette: Well, alright. Let's give it a shot.(They both start attempting some yoga poses while holding onto a pole.)Howard: Uh, Bernadette, I don't think I can touch my toes without grunting. How are people doing this?Bernadette: Beats me, Howard. Maybe they're not human.(They both struggle to maintain their balance and end up collapsing on the floor.)Howard: That didn't go as planned.Bernadette: No kidding. Let's stick to regular workouts from now on.End Scene.</s>
