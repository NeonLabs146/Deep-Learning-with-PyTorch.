But hey, maybe the psychic will surprise you!Psychic: Welcome, my friends. Who shall I read first?Sheldon: Read me, good madam. I'd like to see how accurate your predictions are.Psychic: Alright, let me tap into your energy. Ahh, I sense you have a strong logical mind, but there is a hidden desire for adventure deep within you.Sheldon: Well, that's hardly impressive. Anyone who knows me can deduce that about me.Penny: Sheldon, be nice.Psychic: And for you, my dear, I see a bright future filled with success. But it seems there's a looming decision you're struggling with.Penny: Really? That's... actually pretty accurate.Sheldon: It's just a coincidence, Penny. Don't read too much into it.Psychic: Time will tell, my friends. I've done my part. May the cosmos guide you.End-Scene.</s>
