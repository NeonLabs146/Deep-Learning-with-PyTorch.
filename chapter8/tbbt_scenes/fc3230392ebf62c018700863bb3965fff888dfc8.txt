<s>[INST] Write a small scene with Raj and Howard participating in a science debate: [/INST] Scene: The Cheesecake FactoryRaj: So, Howard, I've been thinking about this for a while now, and I believe the multiverse theory is the key to understanding parallel dimensions.Howard: Oh please, Raj! The many-worlds interpretation is highly flawed. Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation is much more valid in explaining quantum mechanics.Raj: Are you serious, Howard? The Copenhagen interpretation is too simplistic! It fails to account for the wave-particle duality.Howard: Wave-particle duality? That's where the pilot wave theory comes into play! It perfectly explains the interference patterns in the double-slit experiment.Raj: Pilot wave theory? That's just an interpretation hidden behind complex mathematics. It doesn't have the elegance that the holographic principle brings to the table.Howard: Elegance? The holographic principle is just a mathematical analogy, Raj. It doesn't provide any tangible evidence.Raj: Well, at least it doesn't rely on outdated assumptions like your Copenhagen interpretation!Howard: Outdated assumptions? The 1920s called, Raj. They want their theories back!End-Scene.</s>
