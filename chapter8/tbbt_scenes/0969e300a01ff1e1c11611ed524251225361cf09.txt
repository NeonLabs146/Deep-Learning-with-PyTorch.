<s>[INST] Write a small scene about Leonard and Sheldon arguing about thermostat [/INST] Scene: Sheldon and Leonard's apartment.Leonard: Sheldon, can you please stop messing with the thermostat? I like it at 72 degrees.Sheldon: Leonard, I've read multiple studies that prove the optimal temperature for productivity is 68 degrees. I'm just trying to optimize our environment for maximum brain power.Leonard: Well, I'm not a robot like you, Sheldon. I prefer a comfortable temperature. Can't we compromise at 70?Sheldon: Leonard, compromising is not logical. It's either 68 or 72. There's no in-between.Leonard: Fine, Sheldon. Let's settle this scientifically then. We'll both wear thermometers for a week and see who performs better at their respective temperatures.Sheldon: Challenge accepted, Leonard. But I warn you, my brain thrives in the cold.End-Scene.</s>
