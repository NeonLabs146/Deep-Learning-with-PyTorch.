<s>[INST] Write a small scene with Sheldon and Leonard attending a lecture on quantum physics: [/INST] Scene: Lecture Hall at Caltech.Sheldon: (struggling to find a seat) Leonard, there are no good seats left! I need the optimal viewing angle for maximum comprehension!Leonard: Relax, Sheldon. Just sit wherever. It's just a lecture.Sheldon: Just a lecture? This is a lecture on quantum physics, Leonard! It's a sacred event. I need to absorb every detail with precision.Leonard: Fine, let's try to find a good seat then. How about this one in the middle?Sheldon: No, too close to the door. I might get distracted by anyone coming in.Leonard: Okay, what about the one by the window? Lots of natural light.Sheldon: No, too distracting. I could get lost in staring at the outside world instead of focusing on the lecture.Leonard: Alright, how about this one in the back row? No distractions.Sheldon: Perfect, Leonard! That's the sweet spot! Now, we are fully equipped for optimal learning capacity.End Scene.</s>
