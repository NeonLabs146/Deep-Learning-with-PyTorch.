<s>[INST] Write a small scene about Howard and Leonard attempting to brew their own beer: [/INST] Scene: Howard and Leonard's apartment.Leonard: Okay, Howard, here's the recipe. We just need to follow it step by step.Howard: Got it, Leonard. I'm ready to become a master brewer.Leonard: Great. Alright, first step, we need to sanitize all the equipment.Howard: Sanitize? That sounds fancy.Leonard: It's just making sure everything's clean, Howard. We don't want any unwanted bacteria ruining our beer.Howard: Right, right. Sanitizing, got it.Leonard: Next, we need to mix our malt extract with hot water.Howard: Like making tea?Leonard: Kind of, yeah. Brewing beer is like a science experiment, but with delicious results.Howard: I like science experiments. And I really like beer.Leonard: Well, this is perfect then. Now, we let it cool down and then add yeast to start fermentation.Howard: Fermentation? Is that like when my mom leaves vegetables in the fridge too long?Leonard: Sort of, but without the smell. Fermentation is when the yeast eats the sugars and turns them into alcohol.Howard: Ah, so the yeast is our little brewery workers.Leonard: Exactly. And once it's done fermenting, we bottle it and let it carbonate for a couple of weeks.Howard: Can't we just skip to the part where we drink it?Leonard: Patience, my friend. Good beer takes time.End-Scene.</s>
